<p>Information About Me</p>
<p><strong>My</strong> Site is <strong>[</strong>owned and<strong>]</strong> operated by Cathy Winston, sole trader</p>
<p>Registered address: Unit 16935, PO Box 6945, London, W1A 6US</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>What Does This Policy Cover?</li>
</ol>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to your use of <strong>My</strong> Site. <strong>My</strong> Site may contain links to other websites. Please note that I have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and I advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What is Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p>Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.</p>
<p>Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What Are My Rights?</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which I will always work to uphold:</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>The right to be informed about <strong>My</strong> collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact me to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 15.</li>
<li>The right to access the personal data I hold about you. Part 13 will tell you how to do this.</li>
<li>The right to have your personal data rectified if any of your personal data held by me is inaccurate or incomplete. Please contact me using the details in Part 15 to find out more.</li>
<li>The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask me to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your personal data that I have. Please contact me using the details in Part 15 to find out more.</li>
<li>The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.</li>
<li>The right to object to me using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.</li>
<li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to me directly, I am using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask me for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.</li>
<li>Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. I do not use your personal data in this way.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about <strong>My</strong> use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact me using the details provided in Part 15.</p>
<p>Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>
<p align="justify">If you have any cause for complaint about <strong>My</strong> use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What Data Do We Collect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending upon your use of <strong>My</strong> Site, I may collect some or all of the following personal data (please also see Part 14 on <strong>My</strong> use of Cookies and similar technologies and <strong>My</strong> Cookie Policy https://jetpack.com/support/cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name;</li>
<li>Email address;</li>
<li>IP address;</li>
<li>Web browser type and version;</li>
<li>Operating system;</li>
<li>A list of URLs starting with a referring site, your activity on <strong>My</strong> Site, and the site you exit to;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>How Do You Use My Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">Under the GDPR, I must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may be because the data is necessary for <strong>My</strong> performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to <strong>My</strong> use of your personal data, or because it is in <strong>My</strong> legitimate business interests to use it. Your personal data may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating with you. This may include responding to comments from you.</li>
<li>Supplying you with information by email that you have opted-in to (you may unsubscribe or opt-out at any time by contacting me</li>
<li>Analysing your use of <strong>My</strong> Site <strong>[</strong>and gathering feedback<strong>]</strong> to enable me to continually improve <strong>My</strong> Site and your user experience.</li>
<li>Adverts through third-party networks, including Google AdSense and Affiliate Window. Please see their privacy policy for further details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, I may also use your personal data for marketing purposes, which may include contacting you by email with information. You will not be sent any unlawful marketing or spam. I will always work to fully protect your rights and comply with <strong>My</strong> obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and you will always have the opportunity to opt-out.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>How Long Will You Keep My Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p>I will not keep your personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. Your personal data will therefore be kept for the following periods (or, where there is no fixed period, the following factors will be used to determine how long it is kept):</p>
<ul>
<li>The life of this website</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>How and Where Do You Store or Transfer My Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p>I will only store or transfer your personal data in the UK. This means that it will be fully protected under the GDPR.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Do You Share My Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p>I will not share any of your personal data with any third parties for any purposes, subject to one important exception.</p>
<p>In some limited circumstances, I may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if I am involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>How Can I Control My Personal Data?
<ul>
<li>In addition to your rights under the GDPR, set out in Part 5, when you submit personal data via <strong>My</strong> Site, you may be given options to restrict <strong>My</strong> use of your personal data. In particular, I aim to give you strong controls on <strong>My</strong> use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from me which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in <strong>My</strong></li>
<li>You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (“the TPS”), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (“the CTPS”), and the Mailing Preference Service (“the MPS”). These may help to prevent you receiving unsolicited marketing. Please note, however, that these services will not prevent you from receiving marketing communications that you have consented to receiving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can I Withhold Information?</li>
</ol>
<p>You may access <strong>My</strong> Site without providing any personal data at all. You may restrict <strong>My</strong> use of Cookies. For more information, see Part 14.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>How Can I Access My Personal Data?</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">If you want to know what personal data I have about you, you can ask me for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.</p>
<p align="justify">All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 15.</p>
<p align="justify">There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover <strong>My</strong> administrative costs in responding.</p>
<p align="justify">I will respond to your subject access request within one month and, in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, I aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date I receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of <strong>My</strong> progress.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>How Do You Use Cookies?</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><strong>My </strong>Site uses analytics services provided by Jetpack, which useS Cookies. Website analytics refers to a set of tools used to collect and analyse usage statistics, enabling me to better understand how people use <strong>My</strong> Site.

</ol>
<p>I may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. This may be necessary, for example, if the law changes, or if I change <strong>My</strong> business in a way that affects personal data protection.</p>

<p><em>Additional details regarding data use in relation to Jetpack functionality on www.mummytravels.com</em></p>
<p><strong>Activity Log</strong></p>
<p>This feature only records activities of a site’s registered users, and the retention duration of activity data will depend on the site’s plan and activity type.</p>
<p>Data Used: To deliver this functionality and record activities around site management, the following information is captured: user email address, user role, user login, user display name, WordPress.com and local user IDs, the activity to be recorded, the WordPress.com-connected site ID of the site on which the activity takes place, the site’s Jetpack version, and the timestamp of the activity. Some activities may also include the actor’s IP address (login attempts, for example) and user agent.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: Login attempts/actions, post and page update and publish actions, comment/pingback submission and management actions, plugin and theme management actions, widget updates, user management actions, and the modification of other various site settings and options. Retention duration of activity data depends on the site’s plan and activity type. See the complete list of currently-recorded activities (along with retention information).</p>
<p>Data Synced (?): Successful and failed login attempts, which will include the actor’s IP address and user agent.</p>
<p><strong>Comment Likes</strong></p>
<p>This feature is only accessible to users logged in to WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Data Used: In order to process a comment like, the following information is used: WordPress.com user ID/username (you must be logged in to use this feature), the local site-specific user ID (if the user is signed in to the site on which the like occurred), and a true/false data point that tells us if the user liked a specific comment. If you perform a like action from one of our mobile apps, some additional information is used to track the activity: IP address, user agent, timestamp of event, blog ID, browser language, country code, and device info.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: Comment likes.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Form</strong></p>
<p>Data Used: If Akismet is enabled on the site, the contact form submission data — IP address, user agent, name, email address, website, and message — is submitted to the Akismet service (also owned by Automattic) for the sole purpose of spam checking. The actual submission data is stored in the database of the site on which it was submitted and is emailed directly to the owner of the form (i.e. the site author who published the page on which the contact form resides). This email will include the submitter’s IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message.</p>
<p>Data Synced (?): Post and post meta data associated with a user’s contact form submission. If Akismet is enabled on the site, the IP address and user agent originally submitted with the comment are synced, as well, as they are stored in post meta.</p>
<p><strong>Gravatar Hovercards</strong></p>
<p>Data Used: This feature will send a hash of the user’s email address (if logged in to the site or WordPress.com — or if they submitted a comment on the site using their email address that is attached to an active Gravatar profile) to the Gravatar service (also owned by Automattic) in order to retrieve their profile image.</p>
<p><strong>Jetpack Comments</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: Commenter’s name, email address, and site URL (if provided via the comment form), timestamp, and IP address. Additionally, a jetpack.wordpress.com IFrame receives the following data: WordPress.com blog ID attached to the site, ID of the post on which the comment is being submitted, commenter’s local user ID (if available), commenter’s local username (if available), commenter’s site URL (if available), MD5 hash of the commenter’s email address (if available), and the comment content. If Akismet (also owned by Automattic) is enabled on the site, the following information is sent to the service for the sole purpose of spam checking: commenter’s name, email address, site URL, IP address, and user agent.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: The comment author’s name, email address, and site URL (if provided during the comment submission) are stored in cookies. Learn more about these cookies.</p>
<p>Data Synced (?): All data and metadata (see above) associated with comments. This includes the status of the comment and, if Akismet is enabled on the site, whether or not it was classified as spam by Akismet.</p>
<p><strong>Likes</strong></p>
<p>This feature is only accessible to users logged in to WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Data Used: In order to process a post like action, the following information is used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (on which the post was liked), post ID (of the post that was liked), user agent, timestamp of event, browser language, country code.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: Post likes.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Theme</strong></p>
<p>Data Used: A visitor’s preference on viewing the mobile version of a site.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: A cookie (akm_mobile) is stored for 3.5 days to remember whether or not a visitor of the site wishes to view its mobile version. Learn more about this cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong></p>
<p>This feature is only accessible to registered users of the site who are logged in to WordPress.com.</p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Some visitor-related information or activity may be sent to the site owner via this feature. This may include: email address, WordPress.com username, site URL, email address, comment content, follow actions, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">Activity Tracked: Sending notifications (i.e. when we send a notification to a particular user), opening notifications (i.e. when a user opens a notification that they receive), performing an action from within the notification panel (e.g. liking a comment or marking a comment as spam), and clicking on any link from within the notification panel/interface.</p>
<p><strong>Protect</strong></p>
<p>Data Used: In order to check login activity and potentially block fraudulent attempts, the following information is used: attempting user’s IP address, attempting user’s email address/username (i.e. according to the value they were attempting to use during the login process), and all IP-related HTTP headers attached to the attempting user.</p>
<p>Activity Tracked: Failed login attempts (these include IP address and user agent). We also set a cookie (jpp_math_pass) for 1 day to remember if/when a user has successfully completed a math captcha to prove that they’re a real human. Learn more about this cookie.</p>
<p>Data Synced (?): Failed login attempts, which contain the user’s IP address, attempted username or email address, and user agent information.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: When sharing content via email (this option is only available if Akismet is active on the site), the following information is used: sharing party’s name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content. This content will be sent to Akismet (also owned by Automattic) so that a spam check can be performed. Additionally, if reCAPTCHA (by Google) is enabled by the site owner, the sharing party’s IP address will be shared with that service. You can find Google’s privacy policy here.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: To initiate and process subscriptions, the following information is used: subscriber’s email address and the ID of the post or comment (depending on the specific subscription being processed). In the event of a new subscription being initiated, we also collect some basic server data, including all of the subscribing user’s HTTP request headers, the IP address from which the subscribing user is viewing the page, and the URI which was given in order to access the page (REQUEST_URI and DOCUMENT_URI). This server data used for the exclusive purpose of monitoring and preventing abuse and spam.</p>
<p align="justify">Activity Tracked: Functionality cookies are set for a duration of 347 days to remember a visitor’s blog and post subscription choices if, in fact, they have an active subscription.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>WordPress.com Secure Sign On</strong></p>
<p align="justify">This feature is only accessible to registered users of the site with WordPress.com accounts.</p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: User ID (local site and WordPress.com), role (e.g. administrator), email address, username and display name. Additionally, for activity tracking (see below): IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code.</p>
<p align="justify">Activity Tracked: The following usage events are recorded: starting the login process, completing the login process, failing the login process, successfully being redirected after login, and failing to be redirected after login. Several functionality cookies are also set, and these are detailed explicitly in our Cookie documentation.</p>
<p align="justify">Data Synced (?): The user ID and role of any user who successfully signed in via this feature.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>WordPress.com Stats</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Data Used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Important: The site owner does not have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by Automattic for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature.</p>
<p align="justify">Activity Tracked: Post and page views, video plays (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature to honor DNT settings of visitors. By default, DNT is currently not honored.</p>
